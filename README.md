C Mini Projects
=

Here are some of my mini-projects to learn C.

## [Hello World](./hello_world)  
My first program to just get something out.

## [Name](./name)
Very basic user interaction. You give it your name and it says hello!

## [add](./add)
Simple program that adds two user inputs.

# [Compile and Run](./c) (bash script)
A simple bash script to compile given the name of a c file in a folder of the same name.

### Use
Given the file hello_world/hello_world.c

Running the following command:
```
$ ./c hello_world
```
Produces the following output:
```
Removed old binary!
Running hello_world.exe:
Hello World!
```
